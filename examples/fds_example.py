FDS Connector Example
========================
This is an example of the FDSRun Connector class.

The FDS simulation used here simulates a fire starting in the centre of a small room,
with supply and exhaust air vents activating after a few seconds to remove the smoke.

To run this example with Docker:
    - Pull the base FDS image: docker run -it ghcr.io/simvue-io/fds_example
    - Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/simvue-io/connectors-fds.git
    - Move into FDS examples directory: cd connectors-fds/examples
    - Create a simvue.toml file, copying in your information from the Simvue server: nano simvue.toml
    - Install Poetry: pip install poetry
    - Install required modules: poetry install
    - Run the example script: poetry run python fds_example.py

To run this example on your own system with FDS installed:
    - Ensure that you have FDS installed and added to your path: fds --help
    - Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/simvue-io/connectors-fds.git
    - Move into FDS examples directory: cd connectors-fds/examples/fds
    - Create a simvue.toml file, copying in your information from the Simvue server: vi simvue.toml
    - Install Poetry: pip install poetry
    - Install required modules: poetry install
    - Run the example script: poetry run python fds_example.py
    
For a more in depth example, see: https://docs.simvue.io/examples/fds/

This example is set to only simulate 10 seconds of the fire - to see more,
open the file `activate_vents.fds` and update the following lines (eg to increase to 60s):

&TIME T_END=60. /
&DUMP NFRAMES=60, WRITE_XYZ=.TRUE. /
